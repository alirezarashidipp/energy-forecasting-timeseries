# âš¡ Energy Consumption & Price Forecasting (Time Series)

This project develops a robust framework for **time series forecasting** of European energy consumption and pricing.  
It compares **statistical models (ARIMA, Prophet)** with **deep learning (LSTM)** to evaluate forecasting accuracy and applicability in real-world energy planning.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
- **Domain:** Energy Analytics / Time Series Forecasting  
- **Objective:** Predict daily electricity consumption and prices  
- **Impact:** Support energy providers and policymakers in demand planning, cost optimization, and sustainability strategies  

---

## ðŸ—‚ Data
- Source: [ENTSO-E Transparency Platform](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/) (European energy data)  
- Frequency: Daily consumption & market prices  
- Preprocessing:
  - Missing value imputation
  - Lag & rolling window features
  - Calendar-based features (day of week, holidays, seasonality)

---

## ðŸ§® Models Implemented
1. **ARIMA** â€“ Baseline statistical approach  
2. **Prophet (Meta/Facebook)** â€“ Trend & seasonality decomposition  
3. **LSTM (Keras/TensorFlow)** â€“ Deep learning for sequential dependencies  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Results
- **Evaluation Metrics:** RMSE, MAE, MAPE  
- **Key Insights:**
  - Prophet captured strong seasonality patterns  
  - LSTM outperformed ARIMA in capturing non-linear dependencies  
  - Combining models reduced overall forecasting error  

*(Detailed results with plots available in `/notebooks`)*

## ðŸš€ Future Work
- Streamlit dashboard for interactive forecasting  
- Integration with real-time API (ENTSO-E live data)  
- Model explainability using SHAP for time series
